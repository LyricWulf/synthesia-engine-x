# synthesia-engine-x
Remake of LyricWulf's Synthesia Engine X April Fools Joke, to become a real rendering tool

# Our Goal
Originally made as an April Fools joke, we wish to create Synthesia Engine X, make it a rendering tool like none other. While of course it won't be on the same level as videos by LyricWulf himself, they can at least stack up to others, and be better than just a regular Synthesia piano tutorial video.

# Contributing
Please create a branch for WIP PRs, to keep the main from not working if others fork and attempt to run it from that.
The recommended editor is Microsoft Visual Studio, but if you can mimick the style with your own editor, such as with Atom or Notepad++, feel free to use it.
We are using C# as our coding language, if you NEED to inject some other language to do something and have the knowledge of how to, feel free, but know that someone may go over your work and undo it, to put it into C#.
